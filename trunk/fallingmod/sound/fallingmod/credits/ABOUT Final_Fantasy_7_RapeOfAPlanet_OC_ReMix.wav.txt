In order to be able to use this song in this Source Engine Modification,
I had to convert the song to WAV.
However, to comply with the appended Terms of Use as much as possible,

 - I made this text file containing Informations
 - I am also distributing the original file
 - I attributed it in the credits at the end of the game.

If there is a problem with this method, please contact me
and I will IMMEDIATELY remove the song from the mod.

Thank you.

Terms of Use

OverClocked ReMix grants all parties a limited, non-exclusive, non-transferable,
universal license to use, redistribute, incorporate into other works,
and publicly perform OverClocked ReMixes as long as the following criteria are met:

    A.) No profit is made from the exercise of this license.
	This includes but is not limited to incorporation of OverClocked ReMixes into commercial works,
	charging or accepting more than the cost of the delivery means or medium(s) for redistributing
	OverClocked ReMixes, accepting donations and/or offering "Name Your Own Price"
	options for OverClocked ReMixes, or redistributing OverClocked ReMixes in the context of
	commercial advertisements. Live performance or playback of OverClocked ReMixes may occur
	in commercial, for-profit spaces such as stores, private clubs, or other gatherings,
	so long as no cost is explicitly associated with listening to them and no endorsement
	of the commercial entity by OverClocked ReMix can be inferred. 

    B.) If OverClocked ReMixes are being redistributed, performed, or incorporated into other works,
	materials used must be clearly attributed both to the ReMixer(s) who created them and
	to OverClocked ReMix. This accreditation must be in the form of the ReMixer name(s)
	followed by "OverClocked ReMix (http://www.ocremix.org)".
	In applicable contexts where user interactivity is possible, such as websites,
	the site name and URL must be linked to http://www.ocremix.org.
	Accreditation must be presented as close to the utilized material as possible;
	if OverClocked ReMixes are used in a video, accreditation must be included in
	credits at the end, but if displayed on a website, accreditation must be prominently
	displayed in context with the utilized material. In the case of public or semi-public
	performances where accreditation is not reasonable, responding to audience inquiries
	with this information will suffice. 

    C.) If OverClocked ReMixes are being redistributed, they may not be modified in any way
	from the MP3 versions made available on http://www.ocremix.org.
	This includes but is not limited to any modifications to ID3 tagging.
	Modifications for personal use not involving redistribution, such as burning personal
	mix CDs or reformatting files for other devices, is acceptable. 

OverClocked ReMix reserves the right to terminate this license at any time.
In such instances where OverClocked ReMixes have been incorporated into other works
or are being redistributed or performed, the original artist must be contacted
to obtain a separate license for the material in question, and all references
and attribution to OverClocked ReMix must be removed. OverClocked ReMix maintains
sole control of the distribution of materials under its name, as designated by "OC ReMix"
in track titles, the "OC_ReMix" file suffix, or other indicators clearly establishing
attribution of works to OverClocked ReMix. OverClocked ReMix in no way indemnifies
those utilizing OverClocked ReMixes from legal action on the part of third party copyright holders.
